
## Assumptions:
- 0 or below will consider as invalid value  
- I assume that if market is bad today, then just return 0 to indicate such.  
- I assume we only need to provide one record of max profit, in case of multiple occurs, we just return the last one.  
- Inputs are all integer, but I am aware that it is not likely to happen in real life.

## How to run it?
If using visual studion, it can be run via click on run button or kick off all unit tests  

If using command line, just need to go to 'LibFTest\LibFTest' folder/directory, then `dotnet run`  

To kick off unit tests from command line, just need to go to tests filder/directory, then `dotnet test`  

The best way to test my code will be using unit tests.
